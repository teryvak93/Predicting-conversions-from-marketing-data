# Predicting-conversions-from-marketing-data
Direct marketing is an advertising technique where organizations reach out to segments of customers by contacting them personally through email, text message or call etc. Our dataset is related to the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, with data collected from 2008 to 2013. Customers were contacted through a telemarketing campaign, which marketed a product (term deposit) through discussion on one or more calls. A central contact center is used to conduct such campaigns, easing the operational effort involved. By choosing the best possible segment of customers to contact for a campaign, we try to maximize the number of positive responses we can get in a campaign. 

Historical customer data, based on personal attributes and previous interactions with the organization is used to understand the likelihood of a customer responding positively.

Our project objective is to build an efficient classification model which will predict accurately if a customer will subscribe to term deposit or not. This project uses data from previous telemarketing campaigns to train a model to predict response of a customer.
